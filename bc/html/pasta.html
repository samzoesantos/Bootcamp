    <h1>The Importance of Italian Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Italian cuisine (Italian: <i>Cucina italiana</i>) is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora. Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet â€” the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century. It is one of the best-known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.</p>
